# Breast-Cancer-Classifiacation-using-machine-learning
Abstract- Breast cancer is a condition when the breast's cells proliferate uncontrollably. There 
are several forms of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer is determined by which breast 
cells develop into cancer. Healthcare is becoming smarter because of machine learning. Digital 
diagnosis is one instance of machine learning being used in a healthcare setting. In patient 
electronic medical data, machine learning (ML) may identify patterns of certain diseases and 
alert physicians to any irregularities. Finding patient data sets with the required sample size 
and quality to train cutting-edge machine learning models is one of the toughest hurdles. Patient 
data is difficult to gather, exchange, and disseminate since it is covered by stringent privacy 
and security regulations. There are issues with the format and quality of the data as well, which 
often need a lot of work to clean and prepare for machine learning analysis. Inspired by this we 
downloaded the breast cancer dataset - Breast Cancer (METABRIC, Nature 2012 & Nat 
Commun 2016) from cBioPortal. We performed data pre-processing, feature selection, 
classification, and trained a random forest classifier model to detect the cancer symptoms.
