# Breast-Cancer-Classifiacation-using-machine-learning
Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning is a project that utilizes machine learning to detect breast cancer symptoms. With the rise of digital diagnosis and machine learning in healthcare, this project aims to contribute to the field by training a random forest classifier model to identify patterns in patient data sets. The project utilizes the Breast Cancer (METABRIC, Nature 2012 & Nat Commun 2016) dataset from cBioPortal and performs data pre-processing, feature selection, and classification to ensure the quality of the input data.

The project uses several libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, and matplotlib to carry out the necessary operations. The program uses machine learning algorithms such as RandomizedSearchCV, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, and RandomForestClassifier to achieve high accuracy in classifying the breast cancer dataset. Additionally, the project employs confusion matrix and accuracy score metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning model.

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in the healthcare industry and how it can be utilized to provide faster and more accurate diagnosis of diseases like breast cancer.
